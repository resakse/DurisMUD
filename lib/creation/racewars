Race wars and the Good/Evil race concept as portrayed on Duris:
---------------------------------------------------------------

The good races are in general easier to play than the evil races, because the
the life of evil-aligned characters is filled with unanticipated dangers and
hardships.

The evil races on Duris were designed for advanced players who are quite
good at mudding in general and know the Duris rendition of Faerun well.

If you are not VERY good at mudding, and very good at mudding on THIS mud,
you wont get far as an evil race. We definitely suggest playing a good race
for your first character!

Press Return and choose your race with care...
